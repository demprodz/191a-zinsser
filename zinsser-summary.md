# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Damon Wong

American writing is often too cluttered nowadays.  Sentences with the simplest meanings are filled with complex structure 
and unnecessary big words.  Readers cannot understand American writing anymore.  They should not have to think hard while 
reading.  The key to resolve this is to think clearly and simplify.  Writers must eliminate any words that do not serve a 
purpose, or clutter.  There may be countless ways to write something, but the best way is often the simplest form.  To cut 
down on clutter, one can use brackets to isolate unnecessary words, and see if the sentence still holds.
